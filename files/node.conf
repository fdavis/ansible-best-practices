# node.conf
#
# This file is provided by FreeNX. It should be placed either into
# /etc/nxserver/node.conf (FreeNX style) or /usr/NX/etc/node.conf
# (NoMachine NX style).
#
# It is mostly compatible with NoMachine node.conf. The most important 
# difference is that no spaces are allowed when assigning values (eg 
# "A=value" is allowed, "A = value" is NOT).
#
# This file is sourced by bash, so you can do some fancy stuff here if you
# want to, but be aware that it is sourced 3 times per connection. If you 
# want autostart stuff, set NODE_AUTOSTART instead!
# 
#
# You surely are aware that FreeNX is based on the fantastic results that
# the hard work by NoMachine.com has achieved. NoMachine.com released the
# core NX libraries under the GPL. The installation of these libs are the
# precondition for all FreeNX scripts to work. If you are installing this
# software with the help of one of the package management tools of your
# Linux distribution, you can assume that this dependency is taken care of
# by the tool.
#
# You have questions about the inner workings of the NX technology?
#
# Then you are recommended to first check out the rich and very detailed
# NoMachine documentation and their online Knowledge Base at 
#
#           http://www.nomachine.com/kb/
#
# Other sources of information are the NoMachine mailing lists

# This adds the usermode to the possible authentication methods

#ENABLE_USERMODE_AUTHENTICATION="0"

# This adds the passdb to the possible authentication methods

# This adds SU to the possible authentication methods. For it to work the

# Logging directives
#########################################################################

# This directives controls the verbosity of the server-wide log.
# 0: No Logging
# 1: Errors
# 2: Warnings
# 3: Important information
# 4: Server - Client communication
# 5: Information
# 6: Debugging information
# 7: stderror of some applications

# By setting this to 0 the nxserver might be a bit faster, but passwords can be found in the log files.
#NX_LOG_SECURE=1

# Before turning logging on, please make sure that NX_LOGFILE is
# writeable for the "nx" user
#NX_LOGFILE=/var/log/nxserver.log

# This directive controls if the temporary session directory
# ($HOME/.nx/C-<hostname>-<display>-<session_id>) should be kept after a
# session has ended. A successfully terminated session will be saved as
# T-C-<hostname>-<display>-<session_id> while a failed session will be saved
# as F-C-<hostname>-<display>-<session_id>.
# The default is to cleanup the directories.
#SESSION_LOG_CLEAN=1
SESSION_LOG_CLEAN=1

# Amount of seconds nxserver is to keep session history. The default of 2592000
# is equivalent to 30 days. If this is 0 no session history will be kept
# and a negative value denotes infinity.
#SESSION_HISTORY=2592000


#########################################################################
# Forwarding directives
#########################################################################

# FreeNX with ENABLE_SERVER_FORWARD="1" will automatically forward all
# connections to the host specified in SERVER_FORWARD_HOST with the
# secret key SERVER_FORWARD_KEY.
#
# This allows to have a "chain" of NX Servers. Note that you will need to
# use "SSL encryption" for all connections.

#ENABLE_SERVER_FORWARD="0"
#SERVER_FORWARD_HOST=""
#SERVER_FORWARD_PORT=22
#SERVER_FORWARD_KEY="/usr/NX/share/client.id_dsa.key"


# FreeNX with ENABLE_NOMACHINE_FORWARD_PORT="1" will automatically forward all
# connections to the commercial NoMachine nxserver installed on the same
# machine, which go in by port NOMACHINE_FORWARD_PORT. This feature is introduced
# to enable the usage of FreeNX and NoMachine NX side by side on the same machine
# without conflicts.
#
# Note: You need to let SSHD listen to several ports to make use of this
#       directive.

#ENABLE_NOMACHINE_FORWARD_PORT="0"

# LOAD BALANCING
# ==============
#
# To do load balancing setup some hosts in LOAD_BALANCE_SERVERS and
# make:
#
#   - either sure that all incoming connections are sent to the master
#     server by using forwarding directives on the "slave" servers.
#
#   - or share the session database space via NFS between the servers.
#     (not recommended at the moment as race conditions for DISPLAYs can 
#      occur)
#
#TODO Set this up!
#LOAD_BALANCE_SERVERS=""

# The following load_balance_algorithms are available at the moment:
#
# "load", "round-robin", "random"
#
# For "load" you need a script called nxcheckload in PATH_BIN.
# 
# A sample script, which you can change to your needs it shipped with
# FreeNX under the name nxcheckload.sample.

#LOAD_BALANCE_ALGORITHM="random"

# By setting ENABLE_LOADBALANCE="1" you can let users choose their
# preferred host, while being forwarded to another server. Of course
# this is just a preference. The loadbalancing algorithm can completely
# choose to ignore the users choice.
